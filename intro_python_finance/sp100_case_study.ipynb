    "# Introducing the dataset\n",
    "You're going to use what you've learned about Python to conduct a financial analysis of stocks for the companies in the Standard and Poor's S&P 100. The S&P 100 is a stock market index made up of one hundred major companies in the United States that span multiple industries.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "#### S&P 100 Case Study\n",
    "Within the S&P 100, companies are associated with specific sectors. For example, the largest sector is made up of companies associated with the consumer discretionary sector. These include companies like Amazon.com and Nike. The next largest sectors are information technology, healthcare, and financial sectors.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this case study, we'll be analyzing all the S&P 100 companies as well as sector specific companies.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "#### The data\n",
    "For each company, we have data on its name, sector, stock price, and earnings per share, abbreviated EPS. The earnings per share is the profit for each share of stock. Our objective for the first part of our case study is to analyze growth expectations of companies within the S&P 100 by calculating the price to earnings ratio of each company.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "#### Price to Earnings Ratio\n",
    "The price to earnings ratio is used to measure growth expectations of stocks. It is the dollar amount you can expect to invest in a company in order to receive one dollar of the company's earnings. Mathematically, it is the `price per stock share` divided by its `earnings per share`. A higher P/E ratio is generally associated with higher growth expectations."
